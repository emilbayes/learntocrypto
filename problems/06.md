# 06. Our first crypto primitive (hashing)

Now that we have a running bank and a threat model with a high risk target,
let's look at what we can do to mitigate this risk. As mentioned previously,
in this workshop we will be using the cryptographic library called `libsodium`,
exposed to Javascript by the `sodium-native` module. This suite of primitives
has a strong focus on being friendly, hard to misuse and "high level". Many 
of the primitives we will be looking at here also have
equivalents in the core `crypto` module, which is based on OpenSSL.

## Side quest

`sodium-native` is a native module, which in itself can be a side quest to
install. However we (@mafintosh and @emilbayes) try hard to provide prebuilt
binaries for all major platforms and releases of node and electron. This means
you shouldn't have to compile anything when installing the module.

```sh
npm install sodium-native
```

## Buffers

One of the fundamental building blocks that make cryptography practical and
safe (and fun!) in Javascript is the core `Buffer` prototype. `Buffer`s today
are the same as `Uint8Arrays` with some extra methods to make working with them
easier. `Buffer`s in node is the closest you get to raw memory access, but in a
safe manner, so you don't have overflow bugs like you do in C/C++. Below are some of
the most important `Buffer` methods you will be using in the workshop. Namely,
allocating a specific number of bytes, checking for equality and
converting the Buffer back to something that is a printable string:

```js
// Creating buffers
Buffer.alloc(32) // Allocate empty 32 byte Buffer
Buffer.from('Hello, World!') // Allocate buffer and write 'Hello world'
Buffer.from('48656c6c6f20776f726c64', 'hex') // Decode string from `hex`
Buffer.alloc(32).fill('Hello') // Allocate 32 byte Buffer and repeat 'Hello'

buf1.equals(buf2) // Check whether buf1 and buf2 are equal byte by byte

// Converting to printable strings
buf.toString('hex') // Octets in as hexadecimal
buf.toString('base64') // Octets as ascii safe string (base64)
```

Being intimate with `Buffer`s is key to working efficiently with crypto.

## Another side quest

Spin up a node REPL and play around with the Buffer commands listed
above. For example, try generating a 13 byte `Buffer` and write `Hello, World!`
to it. Also try with a 32 byte `Buffer` and see the difference. Decoding
different encodings such as `hex` and `base64` is also very important for later
exercises.

## Hashing

Hash functions are a class of mathematical functions that transform an arbitrary
sequence of data into a fixed size digest. The digest is also often called a
hash or a fingerprint, because the idea is that a hash function should produce
a unique result for every unique piece of data. There are many varieties of
hash functions but here we will only work with cryptographically secure hash
functions.

Cryptographic hash functions provide a much strong guarantee regarding the
uniqueness of the fingerprint, but at the cost of requiring more computation,
and hence, time. However for the particular hash function used by `libsodium`,
context switching from V8 to C will become a bottleneck before hashing does :)

In `libsodium` the general purpose hash function is called BLAKE2b, and is
exposed as [`crypto_generichash(outputBuf, inputBuf, [key])`](https://github.com/sodium-friends/sodium-native#generic-hashing).

## Problem

Write a new program, `hash-example.js`. Using `sodium-native` hash the
string `"Hello, World!"` using the `sodium.crypto_generichash` primitive and
print out the result as a `hex` string. Have a look at the constants defined in
the `sodium-native` documentation (especially the `crypto_generichash_BYTES`),
as these are important guidelines for working effectively with `libsodium`.

# Testing

Running your program it should produce the output
`511bc81dde11180838c562c82bb35f3223f46061ebde4a955c27b3f489cf1e03`.
